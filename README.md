# leetcode

Need to follow up on / bad runtime:
  * https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/
  
Could not even get the brute force to work:
  * https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/ This one took me many many hours, and I had to copy someone's answer from [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/discuss/246683/Runtime%3A-33-ms-faster-than-99.76-of-Java-online-submissions-for-3Sum.) in the end. It only got me 13th percentile (though I ommitted an optimization) https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/211573954/ ***Definitely Revisit this One***
  
This labeled as 'easy' but I had to look up the solution:
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/submissions/
 
 omg this is huge

## Graph Problems to Revisit

* [1192. Critical Connections in Network](https://leetcode.com/problems/critical-connections-in-a-network/): Too hard for me. Need to learn Tarjan's algorithm then figure out how to use for this. Found this video, [Bridges in a Graph](https://youtu.be/thLQYBlz2DM).
